Introduction
==========================================

Given the prevalence of disabling hearing loss in society, our product is envisioned to be an application that would
translate from American Sign Language (ASL) to English. Included in our customer segment are families/workplaces with
ASL users and schools that may want a more efficient way for ASL users to communicate with students/teachers.
Additionally, with the increased demand of virtual conferencing softwares (e.g. Zoom, Teams) due to COVID-19,
we hope to include these companies as a customer segment to ease virtual communication between ASL users and non-users.

Our value proposition is that our services would greatly benefit individuals in the deaf/hard-of-hearing community,
by providing a novel and more efficient means of translation and communication. An example of a gain creator for
our product is that ASL users would have a much easier time communicating with those unfamiliar with ASL.
An example of a pain reliever for our product is that with our product ASL-users in school would not need assistance
from a translator, as ASL users could directly translate their gestures into text that can be easily interpreted
by teachers/other students.
